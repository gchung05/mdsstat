Description: A collection of common statistical algorithms used in active
    surveillance of medical device events. Context includes post-market
    surveillance, pharmacovigilance, signal detection and trending, and
    regulatory reporting. Primary inputs are device-event time series. Outputs
    include trending results with the ability to run multiple algorithms at 
    once. This package works well with the 'mds' package, but does not require 
    it.
