\usage{
ewma(df, ...)

\method{ewma}{mds_ts}(df, ts_event = c(Count = "nA"), analysis_of = NA, ...)

\method{ewma}{default}(
  df,
  analysis_of = NA,
  eval_period = NULL,
  delta = 3,
  lambda = 0.85,
  zero_rate = 1/3,
  mu = NULL,
  sigma = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Required input data frame of class \code{mds_ts} or, for generic
usage, any data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{time}{Unique times of class \code{Date}}
  \item{event}{Either the event count or rate of class \code{numeric}}
}}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed onto \code{ewma} methods}

\item{ts_event}{Required if \code{df} is of class \code{mds_ts}. Named string
indicating the variable corresponding to the event count or rate. Rate must
be calculated in a separate column in \code{df} as it is not calculated by
default. The name of the string is an English description of what was
analyzed.

Default: \code{c("Count"="nA")} corresponding to the event count column in
\code{mds_ts} objects. Name is generated from \code{mds_ts} metadata.

Example: \code{c("Rate of Bone Filler Events in Canada"="rate")}}

\item{analysis_of}{Optional string indicating the English description of what
was analyzed. If specified, this will override the name of the
\code{ts_event} string parameter.

Default: \code{NA} indicates no English description for plain \code{df}
data frames, or \code{ts_event} English description for \code{df} data frames
of class \code{mds_ts}.

Example: \code{"Rate of bone cement leakage"}}

\item{eval_period}{Optional positive integer indicating the number of unique
times counting in reverse chronological order to assess. This will be used to
establish the process mean and moving range.

Default: \code{NULL} considers all times in \code{df}.}

\item{delta}{Required number of sigmas at which to detect a mean shift. Sigma
in this context refers to the estimated standard deviation of the EWMA
statistic.

Default: \code{3} detects a EWMA shift of three sigmas.}

\item{lambda}{Required "memory" parameter in the range (0, 1]. Lower values
assign more weight to prior measurements. A value of 1 indicates no memory
and only considers the current measurement.

Default: \code{0.85} assigns higher weight to the current measurement with
"light memory" of prior measurements.}

\item{zero_rate}{Required maximum proportion of \code{event}s in \code{df}
(constrained by \code{eval_period}) containing zeroes for this algorithm to
run. Because EWMA does not perform well on time series with many 0 values,
a value >0 is recommended.

Default: \code{1/3} requires no more than 1/3 zeros in \code{event}s in
\code{df} in order to run.}

\item{mu}{Optional value of the in-control process mean, typically measured
from historical data.

Default: \code{NULL} estimates the in-control process mean from timepoints
prior to the most recent timepoint in the time series. The most recent
measurement is then tested using this estimate.}

\item{sigma}{Optional value of the in-control process standard deviation,
typically measured from historical data.

Default: \code{NULL} estimates the in-control process standard deviation
from timepoints prior to the most recent timepoint in the time series using
a moving range calculation assuming an n=2 sampling approach. The most recent
measurement is then tested using this estimate.}
}
\value{
A named list of class \code{mdsstat_test} object, as follows:
\describe{
  \item{test_name}{Name of the test run}
  \item{analysis_of}{English description of what was analyzed}
  \item{status}{Named boolean of whether the test was run. The name contains
  the run status.}
  \item{result}{A standardized list of test run results: \code{statistic}
  for the test statistic, \code{lcl} and \code{ucl} for the 95%
  confidence bounds, \code{p} for the p-value, \code{signal} status, and
  \code{signal_threshold}.}
  \item{params}{The test parameters}
  \item{data}{The data on which the test was run}
}
}
\description{
Test on device-events using the EWMA method based on the normal distribution.
}
\details{
Function \code{ewma()} is an implementation of the EWMA
method originally proposed by S.W. Roberts based on the normal distribution.
EWMA is part of the family of statistical process control tests.
